Melbourne is currently experiencing a housing bubble (some experts say it may burst soon). Maybe someone can find a trend or give a prediction? Which suburbs are the best to buy in? Which ones are value for money? Where's the expensive side of town? And more importantly where should I buy a 2 bedroom unit? Content & Acknowledgements
